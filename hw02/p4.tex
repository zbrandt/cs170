\begin{homeworkProblem}[Werewolves (10 points)]

You are playing a party game with $n$ other friends, who each play either as a werewolf or a villager. Your friends know who is a werewolf, but all your friends do. But you know that there are more villagers than there are werewolves. And you also know that villagers always tell the truth, while werewolves can either lie or tell the truth.

Your goal is to identify one player who is definitely a villager. Your elementary query is to pair up two people and ask each whether the other is a villager or werewolf. Your algorithm should work regardless of the behavior of the werewolves.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (5 points) For a given person $x$, devise an algorithm that returns whether or not $x$ is a villager using $O(n)$ queries.
    
    \item (5 points) Show how to find a villager in $O(n \log n)$ queries using a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
