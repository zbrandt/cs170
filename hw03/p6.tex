\section{Counting Shortest Paths (10 points)}

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a vertex $s$, let $p(v)$ be the number of distinct shortest paths from $s$ to $v$; we let $p(s)=1$. Design and analyze an efficient algorithm that outputs a list containing $p(v)$ for every vertex $v$, under the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] (5 points) $G$ is undirected and unweighted.
    \item[(b)] (5 points) $G$ is directed with positive edge weights.
\end{enumerate}

Your algorithm for part~(a) should be more efficient than for part~(b), assuming $|E|$ is significantly smaller than $|V|^2$.
