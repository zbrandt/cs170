\section{Finding Ancestors (5 points)}

You are given a tree $T=(V,E)$ with designated root node $r$, along with a positive integer $K$. Design an $O(|V|)$ time (not $O(K\cdot|V|)$ time) algorithm that outputs the $K$th ancestor (if it exists) of every vertex. Recall that the $K$th ancestor of vertex $v$ is the vertex obtained by walking $K$ steps from $v$ towards the root.
