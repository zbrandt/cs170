\section{Vertex Separators (5 points)}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected, unweighted graph with $n = |V|$ vertices. We call a set of vertices $S$ a \emph{$u-v$ separator} if (1) $S$ does not contain $u$ or $v$ and (2) every path from $u$ to $v$ goes through some vertex in $S$.

Give an efficient algorithm that takes $G, u, v$ as input and finds a $u-v$ separator of size at most $\frac{n-2}{d-1}$, where $d$ is the length of the shortest path from $u$ to $v$. Assume that $u$ and $v$ are connected in $G$ and $d > 1$.

\emph{Hint: Is there a natural way to partition (some of) the vertices that aren't $u, v$ into $d-1$ sets?}
