\section{Testing Ancestors (5 points)}

You are given a binary tree $T = (V, E)$ (in adjacency list format), along with a designated root node $r\in V$. Recall that $u$ is said to be an \emph{ancestor} of $v$ in the rooted tree if the path from $r$ to $v$ in $T$ passes through $u$.

You wish to preprocess the tree so that queries of the form "is $u$ an ancestor of $v$?" can be answered in constant time. The preprocessing itself should take linear time. How can this be done?
