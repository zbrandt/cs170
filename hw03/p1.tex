\section{Skyline (Solo Question; 10 points)}

Given a list of the $n$ buildings in a city on flat ground, you want to compute the skyline. Each building has a rectangular cross-section specified by integers $\ell,r,h$, where $\ell<r$ specify the left and right ends of the building, and $h$ specifies the height.

The skyline, or the entire area covered by the buildings, may be specified by integers $p_0<\cdots<p_m$ and $h_1,\dots,h_m$, meaning that the tallest building between positions $p_{i-1}$ and $p_i$ has height $h_i$, and no buildings lie to the left of $p_0$ or to the right of $p_m$.

Give an efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm to compute the skyline, and analyze the running time. You may assume that each integer operation takes $O(1)$ time.

{\it Hint: Think about merge sort. Can you efficiently (in linear time) merge two skylines?}
