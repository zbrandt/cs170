\section{Trees (10 points)}

Let $T=(V,E)$ be an $n$-vertex tree, that is, a graph for which every pair of vertices is connected by a unique path.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] (5 points) If we remove a vertex of degree $d$, then $T$ is fragmented into $d$ connected subtrees. Give an $O(n)$ time algorithm that takes as input $T=(V,E)$, and outputs a vertex whose removal leaves no connected subtrees containing $>n/2$ vertices. Also explain why such a vertex always exists. Is it always unique?
    
    {\it Hint: think DFS.}
    
    \item[(b)] (5 points) Give an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm that takes as input $T=(V,E)$ and an integer $K$, and outputs the number of pairs of vertices in $V$ that are connected by a path of length~$K$. You may assume that every vertex in $T$ has degree $\leq 3$ (but this assumption is not necessary!).
    
    {\it Hint: use your algorithm from part (a).}
\end{enumerate}
